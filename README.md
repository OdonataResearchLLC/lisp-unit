## lisp-unit

*lisp-unit* is a Common Lisp library that supports unit testing. It is
an extension of the [library written by Chris Riesbeck][orig]. There
is a long history of testing packages in Lisp, usually called
"regression" testers. More recent packages in Lisp and other languages
have been inspired by [JUnit for Java][JUnit].

[Documentation is located on the project wiki.][wiki]

### Features

* Written in portable Common Lisp
* Loadable as a single file
* Loadable with [ASDF][] or [Quicklisp][]
* Simple to define and run tests
* Redfine functions and macros without reloading tests
* Test return values, printed output, macro expansions, and conditions
* Fined grained control over the testing output
* Store all test results in a database object that can be examined
* Group tests by package for modularity
* Group tests using tags
* Signal test completion and return results with the condition.

### Extensions

* Floating point predicates
* [Test Anything Protocol][TAP] output

### How to use lisp-unit

The core definitions of *lisp-unit* may be used by loading the single
file 'lisp-unit.lisp'. To use the extensions, *lisp-unit* must be
loaded using either [Quicklisp][] or [ASDF][].

1. Load (or compile and load) as a single file : `(load "lisp-unit")`.
2. Load using [Quicklisp][] : `(ql:quickload :lisp-unit)`.
3. Load using [ASDF][] : `(asdf:load-system :lisp-unit)`.

## Development Plan

* Version 1.1.0 : Summarize test from multiple packages
* Version 1.2.0 : Improve integration with IDE (mainly SLIME)
