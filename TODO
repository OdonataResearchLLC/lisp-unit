LISP-UNIT TODO

2009-04-15

(1) Generate a tutorial describing how to use LISP-UNT.

(2) Add unit testing for lisp-unit. I think the approach should be to
note some functions and macros as identities that have be verified or
are logically correct. All tests of lisp-unit should then be defined
in terms of the identity functions. Maybe a core set of functionality
should be verified using standard CL comparisons such as eq, eql, =,
etc.

(3) Design better data structures for the sequence and array error
results. The data structure is currently a nested list. Should
probably be a structure or class. Maybe a hash table.

(4) Better integrate the numeric diagnostic functions with the numeric
assertions. Currently, the VALUE and FORM argument of the assertion
must be repeated as arguments to the diagnostic function. The intent
is that you simply note the diagnostic function that you wish to apply
to the test in the event of a failure and the VALUE and FORM arguments
are automagically passed to that function.

(5) Improve the test report. Initially, it would be useful to only
specifically report the failures and otherwise just report the overall
summary. Other improvements might be some sort of progress indication,
like 'PPPPFPPPFFFP.......' where P is pass, F is fail and (.) is not
performed yet. Ideas here are welcome.

(6) Interactive correction of tests. Something along the lines of the
debugger, maybe actually using the debugger. I envision a work-flow
scenario where you run all of the tests and see X of Y tests
failed. Now you enter a form like

  CL-USER> (lisp-unit:run-failed-tests :interactive t)

where the default for interactive is nil. Actually, this approach
could also satisfy the reporting requirements. Anyway, the first
failed test is executed reporting the results and you are provided a
prompt with some options. The options could be along the lines of
abort the testing, pick a diagnostic function to execute or re-run the
test. If the re-run the test option is chosen, it should be after
modifications to the definition of the test or the routine being
tested are made. The idea for this interactive correction feature is
to tighten the debug loop. Input on this idea is highly welcome.

(7) A documentation of the internals would also be useful.
